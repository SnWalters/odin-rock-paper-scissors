# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is a rather simple rock paper scissors game.
What makes it not-so-simple, is that the entire layout, besides
the initial skeleton HTML code, is completely made using JavaScript.

Everything was laid out in a way that if I wanted to come back later and 
add some graphics, I could.

I mostly used Flexbox to organize the layout, with a single Absolute Position
used for the score.

I will have to come back and refactor for smaller screens later on, but for
now, I already did much more than the project itself asked for.

The original project simply asked for a basic UI to change a rock paper
scissors game from a console.log based game, to a UI based game.
